## How good are your predictions?

Quantitatively, how good are the predictions?
```{r}
prediction <- predict(decisionTree, df, type="class")
correct <- prediction == df$class
data.frame(df$class, prediction, correct)
```

Let's look at the proportion of predictions we got right
```{r}
print(sum(correct))
print(nrow(df))
print(sum(correct)/nrow(df))
```
