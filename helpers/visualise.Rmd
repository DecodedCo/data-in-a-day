Let's visualise the mushroom data using the `ggplot` library to see if there are any features in our dataset that could help us predict if a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

We'll create a bar chart, in which each value for `odor` will have a bar, colour-coded according to `class` (edible or poisonous). 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(odor, fill=class)) + geom_bar() 
```
