```{r}
library("rpart")
library("rpart.plot")
```

## Getting the data

```{r}
df <- read.csv("mushrooms.csv")
```



## What data to we have?
```{r}
head(df)
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```


## Making predictions
Build a decision tree
```{r}
decisionTree <- rpart(class ~., data=df, method="class")
```



## How good are your predictions?

Proportion of predictions we got right
```{r}
prediction <- predict(decisionTree, df, type="class")
sum(prediction == df$class)/nrow(df)
```


There is also a lot of information about our tree
```{r}
summary(decisionTree)
```

But it is nice to see it
```{r}
rpart.plot(decisionTree)
```

## Avoiding overfitting
Split data into test and train
```{r}
set.seed(100)  # setting seed to reproduce results of random sampling
trainingRowIndex <- sample(1:nrow(df), 0.7*nrow(df))  # row indices for training data
trainingData <- df[trainingRowIndex, ]  # model training data
testData  <- df[-trainingRowIndex, ]   # test data
```

Re run model with training data
```{r}
decisionTree2 <- rpart(class ~., data=trainingData, method="class")
```

Look at predictions using our test data
```{r}
prediction2 <- predict(decisionTree, testData, type="class")
sum(prediction2 == testData$class)/nrow(testData)
```
